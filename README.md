# Cell Markers Ontology

Description: An ontology of cell type markers.

This ontology integrates cell type markers for cells in the [Cell Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology) from various sources along with details of marker context (anatomical context, assay), confidence (where available) and provenance.   

This ontology is not currently registered with or approved by the OBO foundry.  It is intended, primarily, as a source for the content for the [CL knowledge graph](https://github.com/Cellular-Semantics/CL_KG/).

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found under the `latest` tag on this repository.  Future versions may be available via the OBO foundry PURL http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/clm.owl, if approval is sought and granted.

### Editors' version

This ontology is automatically built from templates and source data files (tsvs). While this repository does contain an editor's file, [src/ontology/clm-edit.owl](src/ontology/clm-edit.owl) content should be added via depositing/editing data files or improvements to templates. 

## Contact

Please use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/Cellular-Semantics/CellMark/issues) to request new content or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.
